# NotesApp
Sqlite based Notes App for Android Devices.
This application uses CRUD operations for creating, inserting, read and update user data for notes.
Java is the programming language of choice. This app also uses recyclervViews for the performace of the app.
A very user friendly interface and Date is added to each Note so that this helps to remember the data by user.
